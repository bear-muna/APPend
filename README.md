## 📝 Description

Bite Buddies offers a platform for users who are looking for a buddy in their area to grab a bite with. Users can create a profile that includes their name, picture (uploaded with cloudinary), location, bio, favorite cuisines, and availability. By browsing potential dining partners based on cuisine preference, users can view profiles and message potential buddies to schedule a meal.
